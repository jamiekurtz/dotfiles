Mac loads a login shell when starting with Terminal

.bashrc only loads with non-login shells on Mac

Therefore, should source .bashrc from one of the other ones.

Recommended approach on Mac (and to be compatible with Linux config):
1. Use .bashrc for all non-aliases
2. Use .bash_aliases for all aliases
3. Source .bash_aliases from .bashrc
4. On a Mac, since it doesn't load .bashrc, you can source it from .bash_profile


bash load order:
1. /etc/profile (system wide, all the time)
2a. ~/.bash_profile (exists after if valid)
2b. ~/.bash_login (exists after if valid)
2c. ~/.profile (exists after if valid)

login shell -> opening via Terminal (i.e. not runnnig a shell or script)
non-login shell -> running a shell or script from terminal
interactive -> interact with in a terminal window
non-interactive -> running a shell script that starts a new script
